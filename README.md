# Nutrition_Prediction_Project
This repo has a machine learning model and a Flask app that predicts Calories, Protein, Carbs, and Fat for foods. It uses data cleaning, text preprocessing (lemmatization), and either RandomForest or XGBoost. The user can enter a food name in the web interface to view estimated nutritional values.
